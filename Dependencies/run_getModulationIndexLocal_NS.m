%
%       Script for calculating phase-amplitude coupling measures for Eisai 
%       between two frequency bands of interest: Mean Vector Length (what Canolty
%       refers to as Modulation Index, but this conflicts with other
%       literature and MVL is a natural name for this, since it is the mean
%       absolute length of a complex vector); and Modulation Index
%       (introduced by Tort, and based on the statistics of the histogram
%       of amplitudes within phase bins, specifically a normalized
%       Kullback-Leibler divergence between observed distribution and a
%       uniform one) - here MI is modified to cover 2 cycles! in order to
%       distinguish events pre-trough vs post-trough.
%
%       This version computes the phase-amplitude coupling measures only
%       for the signal cut-outs around Slow Oscillations (SOs) and not for
%       a continuous signal across the whole stage. This was motivated by
%       the fact that the interest was to examine proper slow oscillations,
%       while taking into account the rest of the signal might create
%       spurious coupling, or obscure the existing one (in cases when SOs
%       are not a majority of the signal). 
%
%       First, SOs are detected with a simple threshold-based algorithm.
%       EEG is filtered into 0.1-4 Hz, consecutive zero crossings are
%       identified, and then deflections of sufficient depth and width are
%       marked as slow oscillations. The filtering is in-built, since most
%       other studies detect SOs on filtered EEG traces. Detection criteria
%       are customizable by the user; suggested parameters are here similar
%       to Massiminis paper. 
%
%       Then filtered and hilbert-transformed phase-providing and
%       amplitude-providing signals are passed to the Modulation Index
%       function along with the sample numbers of detected SOs. Cut-outs
%       around the trough are chosen based on the cycle length, so it is
%       locally adaptive to the SO shape, rather than a pre-defined window
%       (which might result in over-representation of some phase bins,
%       technically): one full cycle before the trough, one full cycle
%       after the trough. The function computes raw values of MVL and MI,
%       and also performs surrogate data generation, so that normalized
%       values of MVL and MI can be obtained, as well as p-values. For
%       maximum customisability, it writes out the surrogate distributions
%       of MVL and MI, as well as computed / estimated angles of the
%       coupling and their distributions.
%       For more detail, see description of getModulationIndexLocal.
%
%       Script saves all the parameters, time of computation, current date
%       and time at the finish, all phase-amp coupling measures and
%       relevant distributions, as well as detected slow oscillations

% WARNING: current version is aimed at nap non-dense EEG data, because it
%          reads in the whole record at once, and with too long recordings
%          or too many electrodes it will likely run out of memory; for
%          other data has to be updated to work via channel-by-channel
%          read-in
%
%          current version is suited for SLOW OSCILLATIONS as
%          phase-providing band ONLY, because the function
%          getModulationIndexLocal assumes the same frequency for for
%          cutting out 2 cycles around SO trough, and for phase-providing;
%          for other phase-providing bands has to be updated to have an
%          additional input frequency for example
